Here is the rewritten documentation in Markdown format with a conversational tone and clear headings:

**All Leads Page**

### Introduction
This page displays all leads for assignment to counselors.

### Breadcrumbbar
The breadcrumbbar is located at the top of the page, showing the current path.

### Contentbar
The contentbar contains the main content of the page.

#### Card

* The card displays information about the leads.
* It includes a form to assign leads to a counselor.
* The form includes a select dropdown for choosing a counselor.

#### Table

* The table displays all leads with options to view and assign each lead.
* Each row represents a single lead, including name, location, interested for, and action buttons (view and assign).

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code is used to manage the checkboxes in the table. When a checkbox is checked or unchecked, it adds or removes the corresponding lead ID from an array.

```javascript
var leads = [];

function myFunction(x) {
    if (document.getElementById(x).checked) {
        leads.push(x);
    }
    if (document.getElementById(x).checked == false) {
        const index = leads.indexOf(x);
        if (index > -1) {
            leads.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }
    console.log(leads);
    if (leads.length > 0) {
        document.getElementById('assign').style.display = "block";
    }
    if (leads.length == 0) {
        document.getElementById('assign').style.display = "none";
    }
}
```

### Form

The form is used to assign leads to a counselor. It includes a select dropdown for choosing a counselor and a button to submit the assignment.

```php
<form action="{{ route('lead.lead.assign.counselor') }}" method="POST">
    <select name="counselor" id="" class="form-control" required>
        @foreach ($counselors as $counselor)
            <option value="{{ $counselor->id }}">{{ $counselor->name }}</option>
        @endforeach
    </select>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="assign"
            style="display:none;">Assign</button>
</form>
```

### Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

* Laravel framework and packages (e.g., `laravel/framework`, `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf`)
* Node.js dependencies (e.g., `@popperjs/core`, `axios`)
