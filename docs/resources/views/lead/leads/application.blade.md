**Exporting School Applications**
=====================================

This section explains how to export school applications.

**Requirements**

* Laravel 9.x
* Livewire 2.x
* Excel 3.x
* Razorpay 2.9

**Getting Started**

To begin, make sure you have installed the required dependencies in your Laravel project.

### Laravel Dependencies

The following are the Laravel dependencies used throughout this project:

```php
composer require arielpmejiadev/larapex-charts "^5.2"
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf "^2.0"
...
```

**Exporting School Applications**

To export school applications, follow these steps:

1. **Select School**: Choose the school from the dropdown list.
2. **Date Range**: Enter the start and end dates for the date range.
3. **Click Export**: Click the "Export" button to generate a CSV file.

### Example Code

Here is an example of how to export school applications using Laravel's `maatwebsite/excel` package:

```php
// controller
public function export(Request $request)
{
    // Select school
    $school = School::find($request->input('school_id'));

    // Get date range
    $startDate = Carbon\Carbon::parse($request->input('start_date'))->format('Y-m-d');
    $endDate = Carbon\Carbon::parse($request->input('end_date'))->format('Y-m-d');

    // Export applications
    return Excel::fromCollection(SchoolApplication::where('school_id', $school->id)->get())
                ->export('school_applications_' . $startDate . '_to_' . $endDate);
}
```

**Exporting School Applications using Livewire**

To export school applications using Livewire, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Livewire component**: Create a new file in `app/Http/Livewire` named `SchoolApplicationExporter.php`.
2. **Import necessary packages**: Import the required packages at the top of the file.
3. **Export data**: Use the `export()` method to export the data.

### Example Code

Here is an example of how to export school applications using Livewire:

```php
// app/Http/Livewire/SchoolApplicationExporter.php
import 'maatwebsite/excel'
import 'laravel/framework'

class SchoolApplicationExporter extends Component
{
    public function export()
    {
        $school = School::find($this->input('school_id'));
        $startDate = Carbon\Carbon::parse($this->input('start_date'))->format('Y-m-d');
        $endDate = Carbon\Carbon::parse($this->input('end_date'))->format('Y-m-d');

        return Excel::fromCollection(SchoolApplication::where('school_id', $school->id)->get())
                    ->export('school_applications_' . $startDate . '_to_' . $endDate);
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**

Exporting school applications can be done using the `maatwebsite/excel` package or Livewire. Make sure to follow the steps outlined above and adjust the code according to your specific needs.

### Example Use Cases

Here are some example use cases for exporting school applications:

* Export all school applications for a particular date range.
