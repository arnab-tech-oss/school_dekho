**Documentation for Lead Management System**

**Introduction**
---------------

This system is designed to manage leads generated from various sources, such as schools and counselor referrals. It allows users to view, edit, and export lead data in different formats.

**User Interface**
-----------------

The user interface consists of a table displaying the list of leads, with columns for Sl No, Name, Counselor, Status, Date, and Action buttons (View, Edit). The system uses Laravel's pagination feature to display multiple pages of results.

### Filtering and Exporting

Users can filter leads based on date range using the "From Date" and "To Date" input fields. They can also export lead data in different formats (Copy, CSV, Excel, Note) by clicking on the corresponding button.

**Code Snippets**

#### Laravel Blade Template
```php
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <form action="{{ route('lead.export') }}" method="GET">
            @csrf
            <input type="text" name="from_date" id=""
                class="form-control" required>
            <input type="text" name="to_date" id=""
                class="form-control" required>
            <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Export</button>
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <!-- Table displaying lead data -->
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Laravel Controller
```php
public function export(Request $request)
{
    // Export lead data to selected format
}
```
**Database Schema**
-----------------

The system uses the following database schema to store lead data:

| Field Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id | int |
| name | string |
| counselor_lead (one-to-many relationship) | integer |
| status | integer |
| created_at | datetime |

**Status Codes**

* 0: Untouched
* 1: Interested
* 2: Not Interested
* 3: No Response
* 4: Admitted
* 5: Admitted through School Dekho

Note: This schema is simplified for demonstration purposes. You may need to add additional fields depending on your specific requirements.

**Security**

The system uses Laravel's built-in security features, such as validation and sanitization, to protect user input data. Additionally, it uses the `@csrf` directive in Blade templates to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

I hope this documentation meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on specific sections.
