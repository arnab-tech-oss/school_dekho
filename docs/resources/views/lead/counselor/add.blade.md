**Overview**
-----------

This is a Laravel Blade template file (`resources/views/lead/counselor/add.blade.php`) that serves as a form to add new counselors. It extends the `layouts.lead.app` layout and includes a breadcrumb navigation, a container with a card, and a form to input counselor details.

**In-Depth Explanation**
-------------------------

### Breadcrumb Navigation

The breadcrumb navigation is displayed at the top of the page, which helps users understand their current location in the application hierarchy.
```markdown
<!-- Start Breadcrumbbar -->
<div class="breadcrumbbar">
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <!-- ... -->
```
The breadcrumb list includes links to previous pages:

* Home (`{{ route('admin.home') }}`)
* Counselor List (`{{ route('lead.counselor.list') }}`)
* Add (current page)

### Form to Input Counselor Details

The form is displayed in a card container, which includes fields for inputting counselor details:
```markdown
<!-- Start Container -->
<div class="contentbar">
    <!-- ... -->

    <div class="card m-b-10">
        <!-- ... -->

        <form action="{{ route('lead.counselor.submit') }}" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            {{ csrf_field() }}
            <!-- Form fields -->
        </form>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- End Container -->
```
The form includes fields for inputting the counselor's:

* Name (`name` field)
* Email (`email` field)
* Mobile number (`mobile` field)

**Usage Examples**
------------------

To use this template, simply include it in your Laravel project and follow these steps:
