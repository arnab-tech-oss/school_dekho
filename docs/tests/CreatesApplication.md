**CreatesApplication.php Documentation**
=====================================

### Overview
-------------

The `CreatesApplication` trait, located in the `tests` namespace, is designed to create a Laravel application instance for testing purposes. It utilizes the `Illuminate\Contracts\Console\Kernel` interface to bootstrap the application.

### In-Depth Explanation
----------------------

#### Creates Application Method

```php
public function createApplication()
{
    $app = require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';

    $app->make(Kernel::class)->bootstrap();

    return $app;
}
```

This method requires the `bootstrap/app.php` file, which initializes the Laravel application. It then makes an instance of the `Kernel` class and bootsstraps it using the `bootstrap()` method. Finally, it returns the created application instance.

**Note:** The `createApplication()` method is a crucial part of the testing process in Laravel. It allows you to create a fresh application instance for each test, ensuring that tests are isolated from each other.

### Usage Examples
-----------------

#### Simple Example

To use this trait, simply add it to your test class:

```php
use Tests\CreatesApplication;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase
{
    use CreatesApplication;

    public function testExample()
    {
        $app = $this->createApplication();

        // Your test code here...
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Example

You can also use this trait to create a test application with specific environment variables:

```php
use Tests\CreatesApplication;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase
{
    use CreatesApplication;

    public function testExample()
    {
        $app = $this->createApplication();

        // Set environment variable for the test
        putenv('DB_CONNECTION=sqlite');

        // Your test code here...
    }
}
```
